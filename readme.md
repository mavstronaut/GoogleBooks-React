# Google Books Search

### Overview

In this activity, you'll create a new React-based Google Books Search app. This assignment requires you to create React components, work with helper/util functions, and utilize React lifecycle methods to query and display books based on user searches. You'll also use Node, Express and MongoDB so that users can save books to review or purchase later.

Based on the [Google Books API](https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes?q=isbn:0747532699)

### Demo

* [View Live on Heroku]()


# Process Summary

* Query GoogleBooks API for `title`, `author`, `description`, `thumbnail` and `link`.
  
* Allows for saving and removal of books from search results.

* Creating `documents` in your `books` collection similar to the following:

    ```js
    {
      authors: ["Suzanne Collins"]
      description: "Set in a dark vision of the near future, a terrifying reality TV show is taking place. Twelve boys and twelve girls are forced to appear in a live event called The Hunger Games. There is only one rule: kill or be killed. When sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen steps forward to take her younger sister's place in the games, she sees it as a death sentence. But Katniss has been close to death before. For her, survival is second nature."

      link: "http://books.google.com/books?id=sazytgAACAAJ&dq=title:The+Hunger+Games&hl=&source=gbs_api"
      title: "The Hunger Games"
    }
    ```

### Bonus Live Updates to Saved Books

* Use React routing and [socket.io](http://socket.io) to create a notification or a component that triggers whenever a user saves an book. Your message should include the title of the saved book.

  * Say you have multiple browsers open, each one visiting your site. If you save an book in one browser, then all of your browsers should notify you that a new book was saved.

  * [Socket.io NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/socket.io)
